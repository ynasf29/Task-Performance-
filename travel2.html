<p style="font-family: courier;">Traveling to zamboanga wuth my family and relatives on a va cation trip was a pleasant experience.</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">The smell of the sea in my nostrils and the air hitting every inch of my body while riding a barge outside the car was a pleasurable experience.</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">I got to live next to the seashore, and it's so much fun to go swimming with my friends, to go to with my mom and ate to pick up balat and sea ocrchins eating under the trees.</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">Every night i saw crabs crawling accross the beach, and those crabs are massive.</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">I made some of whom i still keep in touch with now, but not many.</p>
