<p style="font-family: courier;">Lawyer</p>

<img src="lawyer.jpg" alt="bg" style="width: 300px;" class="center">
<p style="font-family: courier;">Basically, I want to become a lawyer because I believe that it is a good way of rendering service to society and that it will fully develop in me skills, abilities, and attitudes that I can apply in a lot of aspects of my life. 
  I believe that the law profession plays an integral role in any community as it is generally works to analyze and solve legal theories and ensure that justice is enforced. 
  In this regard, I want to be involved in that kind of profession while at the same time ensuring my professional growth</p>
