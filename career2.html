<p style="font-family: courier;">Many people often questioned about my choice, why i choose medicine as my major and my career in the future. Everyone knows that Medicene is dificult and expensive major yet takes the longest time compared to other majors in
  the future. Everyone knows that the medicine is difficult and expesive major yet takes the longest time compared to other majors in the universty. That is the fact that
  we can't ignore. Regardless of that, everyone has their own calling in life. They will give their best effort not only because of that calling, but also their passion and so am I.</p>
